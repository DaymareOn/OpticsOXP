## Thanks
To another_commander for his help and review of my code :-p
To the oolite community and boards, who are very welcoming and friendly.

## Background
DayDreamYard is a young company founded with an original philosophy: each successive CEO would be selected among the most eccentric 8 galaxies' denizens.
Hari Seldon, its first CEO, decided the first equipment to be designed would be a fisheye. He then went into hiding, which caused an immediate crisis.

## Requirements
Oolite v1.81

## Buyable Devices
